Here’s a step-by-step recipe to securely store your AWS access key in an OpenShift Secret and lock it down so only your application pods (via a ServiceAccount) can consume it—no human or other workloads will be able to read it directly.

---

## 1. Create a dedicated Secret

Store your AWS credentials in an **Opaque** secret. We’ll call it `aws-creds`.

```bash
oc create secret generic aws-creds \
  --from-literal=AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-access-key-id> \
  --from-literal=AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret-key> \
  -n my-project
```

* `generic` / `Opaque`: for arbitrary key/value pairs
* Secrets are stored base64-encoded in etcd (enable etcd encryption for at-rest protection)

---

## 2. Define a ServiceAccount for your app

Create a ServiceAccount (`sa-app`) that your Deployment will use. Pods running under this SA will get access to the Secret; regular users won’t.

```bash
oc create serviceaccount sa-app -n my-project
```

---

## 3. Lock down who can “get” the Secret

### 3.1. Create a Role granting only `get` on that Secret

```yaml
# role-read-aws-creds.yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: read-aws-creds
  namespace: my-project
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]               # core API group
  resources: ["secrets"]
  resourceNames: ["aws-creds"]  # limit to only this Secret
  verbs: ["get"]
```

```bash
oc apply -f role-read-aws-creds.yaml
```

### 3.2. Bind the Role to your ServiceAccount

```yaml
# rb-read-aws-creds.yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: bind-read-aws-creds
  namespace: my-project
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: sa-app
  namespace: my-project
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: read-aws-creds
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

```bash
oc apply -f rb-read-aws-creds.yaml
```

> **Result:** Only pods using `sa-app` can `get` the `aws-creds` Secret. No other ServiceAccount, user, or group has permissions.

---

## 4. Remove “view” rights from other users (optional but recommended)

By default, cluster users with the built-in `view` role can list or get *all* secrets in a namespace. You can revoke that:

```bash
oc policy remove-role-from-group view system:authenticated -n my-project
```

> **Caution:** This revokes wide read access for regular developers in the project. Make sure they still have needed permissions for other resources (e.g., ConfigMaps, Pods).

---

## 5. Reference the Secret in your Deployment

Ensure your Deployment uses the `sa-app` ServiceAccount and injects the AWS creds as environment variables:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
  namespace: my-project
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels: { app: my-app }
  template:
    metadata:
      labels: { app: my-app }
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: sa-app      # 🔑 important
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: myregistry/my-app:latest
        env:
        - name: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: aws-creds
              key: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
        - name: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: aws-creds
              key: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

1. **`serviceAccountName: sa-app`** ensures the pod runs with only the permissions we granted.
2. The AWS keys are never exposed in plain text outside the pod.

---

## 6. Verification

* **Try as a normal user**:

  ```bash
  oc auth can-i get secret/aws-creds -n my-project
  ```

  → should respond `no`.

* **Try as the SA via a debug pod**:

  ```bash
  oc run debug --rm -i --tty --serviceaccount=sa-app --image=registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi \
    -- /bin/bash
  # inside the container:
  echo $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID   # should print the key
  ```

---

## 7. Best Practices & Extras

* **Rotate**: to rotate keys, create a new Secret (e.g. `aws-creds-v2`), update only the Deployment, then delete the old one.
* **Audit**: enable audit logs on Secret access.
* **Encryption at rest**: configure OpenShift’s etcd encryption for the `secrets` resource.
* **External vault**: for higher security, integrate HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager via CSI driver instead of native Secrets.

By isolating your AWS keys in its own Secret, granting read-only access exclusively to a dedicated ServiceAccount, and binding that SA to only your Deployment, you ensure no other users or workloads can retrieve those credentials—yet your code can consume them seamlessly.
